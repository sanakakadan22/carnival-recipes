Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
1 (28 oz.) can petite diced tomatoes
1 tsp salt (or to taste)

10. Stir to combine, place a lid on top, and allow the pasta to cook in the pepper sauce for about 5 more minutes, or until it has absorbed most of the liquid in the pot.
11. Add about a half teaspoon of salt, taste, and add more if needed.
=======
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)

2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
